                Known as one of the world's major global cities, <strong>London</strong> exerts a strong influence on
                world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education, healthcare, media, science, technology,
                tourism, transport, and communications. As the capital and largest city of the United Kingdom, it hosts
                Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions and is home to several of the world's
                leading academic institutions. Additionally, the diverse culture encompasses over 300 languages, making
                London Europe's third-most populous city.

            <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
            <p>
                No trip to London is complete without visiting the <strong>Elisabeth Tower</strong>, the tall clock
                tower next to <strong>House of Parliament</strong>. It lays next to the River Thames with the giant
                ferris wheel <strong>London Eye</strong> on the other side of the river. The breathtaking view from the
                ferris wheel over all London is unforgetable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another must-visit is the <strong>Buckingham Palace</strong>. Even though the palace itself is only open
                to the public during a limited number of months in the summer, the change of guards in front of the
                palace is a great experience, especially for children. Also, the <strong>Tower Bridge</strong> with the
                <strong>Tower of London</strong> next to it is a perfect mixture of history and innovations.

            <h2>Food & Drink</h2>
            <p>
                While the British kitchen isn't known for outstanding dishes, there are some must-trys in London. The
                first dish is <em>Fish and Chips</em>. It is a quintessential British dish, and very popular as street
                food. Another famous dish is a traditional <em>Full English Breakfast</em>, including eggs, bacon,
                sausages, beans, and toast. Another favourite for British people is the <em>Sunday Roast</em>, a savory
                meal with roasted meat, potatoes, vegetables, and gravy. The best place to enjoy these dishes is in a
                traditional pub or on street markets, such as Camden Market.

            <h2>Culture & Festivals</h2>
            <p>
                The urban culture of London includes music, theatre, festivals, and museums. There are three major
                concert halls in London: the Barbican Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, and the Royal Albert Hall.
                Additionally, London has a famous rock music scene, and some of the greatest artists of the 60s and 70s
                played in London. Until today the music scene is vibrating, especially in places like <strong>Covent
                    Garden</strong>, where street artists show of their creative abilities. The city is also known for
                its theatre quarter with the <strong>West End</strong>, but London is also home to the
                <strong>Shakespeare's Globe</strong>. Throughout the year, there are over 40 festivals per year in
                London. The most famous one being the <strong>Notting Hill Carnival</strong> with a distinctly
                Afro-Caribbean vibe. Furthermore, London is home to over 240 museums and galleries. The most famous ones
                being the <strong>British Museum</strong> and <strong>Tate Modern</strong>.

            <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
            <p>
                The best time to visit London is between May and July, when the summer weather brings the city to life,
                even though one should never forget an umbrella when visiting London. English is the official language,
                and the local currency is
                the British Pound (£). While London is generally safe for tourists, it’s smart to stay aware of your
                belongings, especially in crowded areas. Pickpockets use big crowds to steal money from especially
                tourists.
