            <h4>Fish and Chips</h4> <!-- City Page Content, change according tp your city -->
            <br>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>680.39 g white fish fillets, cut into long strips</li>
                <li>125 g all-purpose flour , plus more for dredging fish</li>
                <li>64 g cornstarch</li>
                <li>6.5 g baking powder</li>
                <li>0.5 g paprika</li>
                <li>3 g salt, plus more for seasoning fish</li>
                <li>0.5 g freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning fish</li>
                <li>236 g cold light beer</li>
                <li>hot cooked fries</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat Oil: Add oil to a deep pot - about 1-2 inches full - and heat oil to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, chop the dried tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Prepare Fish: Depending on the size and shape of your fillets, cut them into strips that are long
                    and at least 1 inch wide. Lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season them generously
                    with sea salt and pepper and then dredge each filet in a little bit of flour.</li>
                <li>Make Batter: In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, salt and pepper.
                    Whisk in the beer (or club soda) to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a slightly
                    thick, smooth batter. If it’s too thick, add a little more beer.</li>
                <li>Batter and Fry: Check oil temperature to make sure it’s about 350 degrees F. Dip prepared fillets
                    into the batter and use a spoon if needed to help coat the entire fillet. Working in small batches
                    so you don’t overcrowd the pans, carefully lower a few dipped fillets at a time into the hot oil.
                    Fry for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until the batter is crisp and golden and
                    the fish is perfectly cooked. I like to cook just one at the beginning to get an estimated cook
                    time, before cooking more. You don’t want to overcook the fish! Keep in mind the fish will continue
                    to cook a little more as it cools off on the paper towel.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. You can keep the cooked
                    fish warm in a 200 degree oven while you cook it all, if you want.</li>
                <li>Use the same pot of hot oil to make French Fries, or make my Baked French Fries or Air Fryer French
                    Fries. Serve with homemade tartar sauce (it can be made days ahead of time!) and malt vinegar, for
                    dipping.</li>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>            <br>
            <p>Make the beef and vegetables</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat 1 (about 3-pound) beef rump or round roast dry with paper towels. Season all over with 2
                    teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Let sit at room temperature for at least
                    1 or up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, peel 1 pound medium carrots and 1 pound medium parsnips. Halve
                    crosswise, then halve or quarter each piece lengthwise so they are all about the same size.</li>
                <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375ºF.</li>
                <li>Finely grate 3 garlic cloves. Pick the leaves from 3 fresh rosemary sprigs, then finely chop (2 to 3
                    tablespoons). Place the garlic, rosemary, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small bowl and stir
                    to combine. Rub the mixture all over the beef. Place in the middle of a roasting pan or rimmed
                    baking sheet fat-side up.</li>
                <li>Scatter the carrots and parsnips around the beef. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
                    oil, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and stir
                    to coat. Arrange into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Roast until the outside of the roast is browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to
                    275ºF. Roast until the beef is medium rare (registers 125ºF on an instant-read thermometer in the
                    thickest part), about 1 hour more, checking the temperature after 30 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the
                    potatoes.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Make the potatoes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and cut 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Place in a large saucepan or pot
                    and add enough cold water to cover by about 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and bring to
                    a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the potatoes are
                    nearly knife tender but not totally soft, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then
                    shake the colander to rough up the edges of the potatoes.</li>
                <li>When the beef is ready, transfer the beef and vegetables to a serving platter with tongs. Tent the
                    platter with aluminum foil to keep warm. Reserve the roasting pan or baking sheet and the pan
                    drippings. Increase the oven temperature to 450ºF.</li>
                <li>Place 1/3 cup melted duck fat, chicken fat, butter, beef tallow, bacon fat, or olive oil; the
                    remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt; and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder on a rimmed baking sheet (do not
                    use the one from the roast). Add the potatoes and gently toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer.
                    Roast, stirring every 20 minutes, until golden-brown and very crisp, 60 to 80 minutes total.
                    Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce and gravy.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Make the horseradish sauce and gravy</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Juice 1/2 medium lemon into a medium bowl until you have 1 tablespoon. Finely chop 1 small bunch
                    chives until you have 1 tablespoon. Add the chives, 1/2 cup crème fraîche or sour cream, 1/4 cup
                    prepared horseradish, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the bowl, and stir to
                    combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>About 20 minutes before the potatoes are ready, place 1/4 cup of the beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour any drippings from the roasting pan or
                    baking sheet into a small saucepan. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>While whisking constantly, add the cornstarch mixture. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until
                    the gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Taste and season with kosher
                    salt and black pepper as needed. Remove the saucepan from the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>If desired, return the beef, carrots, and parsnips to a 200ºF oven to rewarm. Transfer the beef to a
                    clean cutting board and cut across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with the carrots,
                    parsnips, potatoes, gravy, horseradish sauce, and Yorkshire pudding. Lightly sprinkle the beef with
                    flaky salt and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs if desired.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>680.39 g white fish fillets, cut into long strips</li>
                <li>125 g all-purpose flour , plus more for dredging fish</li>
                <li>64 g cornstarch</li>

                <li>0.5 g paprika</li>
                <li>3 g salt, plus more for seasoning fish</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat Oil: Add oil to a deep pot - about 1-2 inches full - and heat oil to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, chop the dried tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Prepare Fish: Depending on the size and shape of your fillets, cut them into strips that are long
                    and at least 1 inch wide. Lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season them generously
                    with sea salt and pepper and then dredge each filet in a little bit of flour.</li>
                <li>Make Batter: In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, salt and pepper.
                    Whisk in the beer (or club soda) to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a slightly
                    thick, smooth batter. If it’s too thick, add a little more beer.</li>
                <li>Batter and Fry: Check oil temperature to make sure it’s about 350 degrees F. Dip prepared fillets
                    into the batter and use a spoon if needed to help coat the entire fillet. Working in small batches
                    so you don’t overcrowd the pans, carefully lower a few dipped fillets at a time into the hot oil.
                    Fry for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until the batter is crisp and golden and
                    the fish is perfectly cooked. I like to cook just one at the beginning to get an estimated cook
                    time, before cooking more. You don’t want to overcook the fish! Keep in mind the fish will continue
                    to cook a little more as it cools off on the paper towel.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. You can keep the cooked
                    fish warm in a 200 degree oven while you cook it all, if you want.</li>
                <li>Use the same pot of hot oil to make French Fries, or make my Baked French Fries or Air Fryer French
                    Fries. Serve with homemade tartar sauce (it can be made days ahead of time!) and malt vinegar, for
                    dipping.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>            <br>
            <p>Make the beef and vegetables</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat 1 (about 3-pound) beef rump or round roast dry with paper towels. Season all over with 2
                    teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Let sit at room temperature for at least
                    1 or up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, peel 1 pound medium carrots and 1 pound medium parsnips. Halve
                    crosswise, then halve or quarter each piece lengthwise so they are all about the same size.</li>
                <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375ºF.</li>
                <li>Finely grate 3 garlic cloves. Pick the leaves from 3 fresh rosemary sprigs, then finely chop (2 to 3
                    tablespoons). Place the garlic, rosemary, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small bowl and stir
                    to combine. Rub the mixture all over the beef. Place in the middle of a roasting pan or rimmed
                    baking sheet fat-side up.</li>
                <li>Scatter the carrots and parsnips around the beef. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
                    oil, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and stir
                    to coat. Arrange into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Roast until the outside of the roast is browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to
                    275ºF. Roast until the beef is medium rare (registers 125ºF on an instant-read thermometer in the
                    thickest part), about 1 hour more, checking the temperature after 30 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the
                    potatoes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make the potatoes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and cut 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Place in a large saucepan or pot
                    and add enough cold water to cover by about 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and bring to
                    a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the potatoes are
                    nearly knife tender but not totally soft, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then
                    shake the colander to rough up the edges of the potatoes.</li>
                <li>When the beef is ready, transfer the beef and vegetables to a serving platter with tongs. Tent the
                    platter with aluminum foil to keep warm. Reserve the roasting pan or baking sheet and the pan
                    drippings. Increase the oven temperature to 450ºF.</li>
                <li>Place 1/3 cup melted duck fat, chicken fat, butter, beef tallow, bacon fat, or olive oil; the
                    remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt; and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder on a rimmed baking sheet (do not
                    use the one from the roast). Add the potatoes and gently toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer.
                    Roast, stirring every 20 minutes, until golden-brown and very crisp, 60 to 80 minutes total.
                    Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce and gravy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make the horseradish sauce and gravy</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Juice 1/2 medium lemon into a medium bowl until you have 1 tablespoon. Finely chop 1 small bunch
                    chives until you have 1 tablespoon. Add the chives, 1/2 cup crème fraîche or sour cream, 1/4 cup
                    prepared horseradish, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the bowl, and stir to
                    combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>About 20 minutes before the potatoes are ready, place 1/4 cup of the beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour any drippings from the roasting pan or
                    baking sheet into a small saucepan. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>While whisking constantly, add the cornstarch mixture. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until
                    the gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Taste and season with kosher
                    salt and black pepper as needed. Remove the saucepan from the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>If desired, return the beef, carrots, and parsnips to a 200ºF oven to rewarm. Transfer the beef to a
                    clean cutting board and cut across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with the carrots,
                    parsnips, potatoes, gravy, horseradish sauce, and Yorkshire pudding. Lightly sprinkle the beef with
                    flaky salt and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs if desired.</li>

            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>            <br>
            <p>Make the beef and vegetables</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat 1 (about 3-pound) beef rump or round roast dry with paper towels. Season all over with 2
                    teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Let sit at room temperature for at least
                    1 or up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, peel 1 pound medium carrots and 1 pound medium parsnips. Halve
                    crosswise, then halve or quarter each piece lengthwise so they are all about the same size.</li>
                <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375ºF.</li>
                <li>Finely grate 3 garlic cloves. Pick the leaves from 3 fresh rosemary sprigs, then finely chop (2 to 3
                    tablespoons). Place the garlic, rosemary, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small bowl and stir
                    to combine. Rub the mixture all over the beef. Place in the middle of a roasting pan or rimmed
                    baking sheet fat-side up.</li>
                <li>Scatter the carrots and parsnips around the beef. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
                    oil, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and stir
                    to coat. Arrange into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Roast until the outside of the roast is browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to
                    275ºF. Roast until the beef is medium rare (registers 125ºF on an instant-read thermometer in the
                    thickest part), about 1 hour more, checking the temperature after 30 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the
                    potatoes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make the potatoes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and cut 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Place in a large saucepan or pot
                    and add enough cold water to cover by about 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and bring to
                    a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the potatoes are
                    nearly knife tender but not totally soft, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then
                    shake the colander to rough up the edges of the potatoes.</li>
                <li>When the beef is ready, transfer the beef and vegetables to a serving platter with tongs. Tent the
                    platter with aluminum foil to keep warm. Reserve the roasting pan or baking sheet and the pan
                    drippings. Increase the oven temperature to 450ºF.</li>
                <li>Place 1/3 cup melted duck fat, chicken fat, butter, beef tallow, bacon fat, or olive oil; the
                    remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt; and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder on a rimmed baking sheet (do not
                    use the one from the roast). Add the potatoes and gently toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer.
                    Roast, stirring every 20 minutes, until golden-brown and very crisp, 60 to 80 minutes total.
                    Meanwhile, make the horseradish sauce and gravy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make the horseradish sauce and gravy</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Juice 1/2 medium lemon into a medium bowl until you have 1 tablespoon. Finely chop 1 small bunch
                    chives until you have 1 tablespoon. Add the chives, 1/2 cup crème fraîche or sour cream, 1/4 cup
                    prepared horseradish, 1 tablespoon water, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to the bowl, and stir to
                    combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>About 20 minutes before the potatoes are ready, place 1/4 cup of the beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour any drippings from the roasting pan or
                    baking sheet into a small saucepan. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups beef broth and 2 tablespoons
                    Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>While whisking constantly, add the cornstarch mixture. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until
                    the gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Taste and season with kosher
                    salt and black pepper as needed. Remove the saucepan from the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>If desired, return the beef, carrots, and parsnips to a 200ºF oven to rewarm. Transfer the beef to a
                    clean cutting board and cut across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with the carrots,
                    parsnips, potatoes, gravy, horseradish sauce, and Yorkshire pudding. Lightly sprinkle the beef with
                    flaky salt and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs if desired.</li>
